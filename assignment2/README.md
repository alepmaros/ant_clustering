# Ant Clustering - Assignment 2

This is the second Assignment2.

Now Ants have weights and belong to different groups, therefore they need to be
agrouped in their groups given a similarity function.

# The Idea

In an ambient with Alive and Dead ants, the Alive ones tend to agroup the dead
ones, thus making more space available for movement. This a simple behaviour that
can be used in real life to organise documents, for example.

# Implementation

The implementation is done using C++ and SFML.

Similarity Equations used are in the Report.
