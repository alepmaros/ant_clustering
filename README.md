# Ant Clustering algorithm/visualisation

This is a class project for my Artificial Intelligence course.

# The Idea

In an ambient with Alive and Dead ants, the Alive ones tend to agroup the dead
ones in groups, thus making more space available for movement.

# Implementation

The implementation is done using C++ and SFML
