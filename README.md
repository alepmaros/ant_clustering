# Ant Clustering algorithm/visualisation

This is a class project for my Artificial Intelligence course.

# The Idea

In an ambient with Alive and Dead ants, the Alive ones tend to agroup the dead
ones, thus making more space available for movement. This a simple behaviour that
can be used in real life to organise documents, for example.

# Implementation

The implementation is done using C++ and SFML
