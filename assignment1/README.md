# Ant Clustering - Assignment 1

This is the first assignment with the ants. They organise data just comparing 
proximity. All the dead ants have the same weight.

Here is a experiment with 6000 dead ants and 100 alive ones in a 160x160 grid.

(a): Initial Board
(b): Radius 1
(c): Radius 5
(d): Radius 10

# The Idea

In an ambient with Alive and Dead ants, the Alive ones tend to agroup the dead
ones, thus making more space available for movement. This a simple behaviour that
can be used in real life to organise documents, for example.

# Implementation

The implementation is done using C++ and SFML
